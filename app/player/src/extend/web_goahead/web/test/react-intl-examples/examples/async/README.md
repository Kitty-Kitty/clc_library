React Intl Async Example
========================

This is a runnable example showing how to use React Intl with translations being loaded asynchronously.

## Running

**You first need to build the main React Intl library:**

```
$ cd ../..
$ npm run build
$ cd examples/async/
```

Then you can build and run this example:

```
$ npm run build
$ npm start
```

or you can edit the source in `index.js` and recompile the example on fly :

```
$ npm run watch
$ npm start
```
