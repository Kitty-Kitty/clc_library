React Intl + React Router Example
==============================

This is a runnable example showing how to use React Intl with [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router).

This example app wraps the `<Router>` component with an `<IntlProvider>` and uses `<Formatted*>` components within the components the router will render.

## Running Example

**In the project directory, run:**
```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
**Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.**
